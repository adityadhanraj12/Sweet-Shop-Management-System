Typography is tall, narrow, and contemporary, used in large sizes for headings and smaller sizes for body text, reinforcing a clean and edgy tone. UI components like buttons and navigation are minimalistic with rounded shapes and high contrast. Artistic use of blurred color gradients behind text adds depth and a subtle creative flair. Overall, the design conveys a youthful, indie, and sophisticated personality suitable for cultural or music festival websites.",

UI components such as buttons and icons are simple, rectangular, and line-based, using the primary blue for emphasis. Overall, the design communicates a confident, data-driven, and professional brand identity suitable for digital marketing, consulting, or technology sectors.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color predominantly for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and interactive elements to draw user attention effectively. The 'primaryForeground' color should be used for text and icons placed on 'primary' backgrounds to ensure readability. The 'secondary' color serves as the main color for large background areas and text in dark mode or high-contrast sections, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons on these dark backgrounds. The 'background' color is the base for most page backgrounds, providing a clean and neutral canvas. The 'backgroundDark' custom color is reserved for dark-themed sections or overlays, maintaining contrast with 'secondaryForeground'. The 'accentBlueLight' can be used sparingly for subtle highlights or hover states to complement the 'primary' color. All colors should be combined to maintain strong contrast ratios, ensuring accessibility and visual clarity across the site.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of 'primary' (#5C5CF6) with 'primaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) meets WCAG AA standards for text and UI elements, providing sufficient contrast. The 'secondary' (#000000) and 'secondaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) pairing offers excellent contrast, suitable for all text sizes and UI components. The 'background' (#FFFFFF) with 'secondary' (#000000) text also meets WCAG AAA standards for body text. The 'backgroundDark' (#121212) with 'secondaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) ensures high contrast for dark mode or dark sections. Overall, the palette supports accessible design with clear visual hierarchy and legibility."
